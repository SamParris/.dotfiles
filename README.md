# > .dotfiles (Windows Environment Configuration) üñ•Ô∏è

## What is it?
This is my completely customised .dotfiles for windows üöÄ This is based heavily on the way .dotfiles are used within Linux for control and customisations on both the OS aswell as various apps.

PowerShell is my main focus and what I use most of this for, so that is what this has been designed around.

This project and GitHub Repo is developed for my own sole enjoyment and personal learning, the only "End-User" I care about in all of this, is myself üòÇ I make no promises on any usability, stability or practicality of anything found here.

## How does it work?
The backbone for this whole setup is in the [`Setup.ps1`](Setup.ps1) file, once the repo is cloned and [`Setup.ps1`](Setup.ps1) is ran, it will install and configure all the various apps or OS settings I use on a daily basis, allowing me to quickly setup new PCs that I'm using or ensure my settings are the same across multiple PCs.

### Setup
Open either command prompt or Windows Terminal and run the following (I personally recommend cloning directly into *C:\Users\YOURNAME*  this will create .dotfiles within your HOME directory.)

git clone https://github.com/SamParris/.dotfiles.git
