# UltimateKeyboard.ahk ⌨️

## Setup
All of my shortcuts and keybindings are written using [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/), Once installed I place a symlink to [`UltimateKeyboard.ahk`](UltimateKeyboard.ahk) (This can be done manually or by running [`Setup.ps1`](/Setup.ps1)) into the startup folder in Windows.

## Shortcuts & Keybindings
Shortcuts and keybindings for Windows (OS) management such as moving and resizing windows, aswell as opening and interacting with system applications.

All the keyboards I currently use have an **Alt Gr** key which I am using as the main modifier key (referred to as the "Master") with the option of using **Shift** for complimentary shortcuts.
