## Keybindings.json

I try to make sure my VSCode shortcuts adhere to ***key*** principles

`Alt Key` Used for **Navigation** actions (Changing views, moving between the explorer and the editor.)\
`Ctrl Key` Used for **Non-Navigation** actions (Search, Find & Replace, close editors etc.)\
`Shift Key` Used for **Complementary** actions (assigned with either the `Alt` or `Ctrl` key.)

### Common Shortcuts

#### Alt + KEY

`Alt+D` Move to next editor in current group\
`Alt+Shift+D` Move focus to next group\
`Alt+A` Move to previous editor in current group\
`Alt+Shift+A` Move focus to previous group\
`Alt+E` Change focus to File Explorer

#### Ctrl + KEY

`Ctrl+K` Close all saved editors\
`Ctrl+N` New File\
`Ctrl+Shift+N` New Directory
